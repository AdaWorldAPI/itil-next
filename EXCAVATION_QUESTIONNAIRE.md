# System Excavation: Your Experience

## Purpose

You've worked with multiple ticket systems across Vodafone, Sony, Microsoft, and now DATAGROUP. This document captures what worked, what sucked, and what we should steal or avoid.

---

## KIAS (Vodafone)

### What was it?
- [ ] Full name / vendor?
- [ ] Incident only or full ITIL?
- [ ] Cloud or on-prem?

### What worked well?
```
(describe the good parts)



```

### What was painful?
```
(describe the friction)



```

### Features to steal?
```
(specific things to bring to ITIL-NEXT)



```

---

## Sony System

### What was it?
- [ ] System name / vendor?
- [ ] Your role when using it?

### The Escalation Envelope

You mentioned liking "simply adding an escalation envelope" - this is gold. Help me understand:

```
How did you create an envelope?
(button? right-click? keyboard shortcut?)



What information was in the envelope?
(to-team, reason, deadline?)



How did it appear in the UI?
(nested? side panel? tab?)



Could you have multiple envelopes at once?
(parallel escalations to different teams?)



When envelope closed, what happened?
(summary posted? notification? auto-close?)



```

### Other good features?
```



```

---

## Microsoft System

### What was it?
- [ ] System name?
- [ ] ServiceNow? Dynamics? Custom?

### What stood out?
```
(good or bad)



```

### Integration with MS ecosystem?
```
(Teams, Outlook, SharePoint?)



```

---

## Valuemation (Current Pain)

### What's most terrible?

Rate 1-5 (5 = unbearable):

| Area | Pain Level | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Ticket creation | /5 | |
| Finding tickets | /5 | |
| Escalation process | /5 | |
| Email integration | /5 | |
| Reporting | /5 | |
| Mobile access | /5 | |
| Speed/performance | /5 | |
| UI/navigation | /5 | |

### Specific friction points?
```
(the things that make you curse daily)



```

### What do your colleagues complain about most?
```



```

### Anything surprisingly good?
```
(even Valuemation might have one thing)



```

---

## HubSpot (Reference)

### What makes HubSpot's reputation good?

```
(from your observation or colleagues' feedback)



```

### Specific features worth stealing?

```



```

---

## Jira / OpenProject

### Used either for ticketing?
- [ ] Jira
- [ ] OpenProject
- [ ] Both
- [ ] Neither

### Kanban patterns that worked?
```



```

### What was overkill / not needed?
```



```

---

## Your Dream Feature

If you could have ONE feature that none of these systems have:

```



```

---

## Priority for ITIL-NEXT

Rank these features (1 = most important):

| Feature | Rank |
